		<h3> About Me</h3>
		<p>My name is Carrie de Freitas, and welcome to Carried with You. My love of sewing began over a decade ago, and since then, I've enjoyed creating both one-of-a-kind and pattern-inspired pieces for myself, family and friends. I'm so excited to be able to share my passion and creativity with others, and hope that you, too, can find a piece that inspires you.
