	<h3>Handmade Bags & Accessories</h3>
	
	<p>My love of sewing began over a decade ago, and since then, I've enjoyed creating both one-of-a-kind and pattern-inspired pieces for myself, family and friends. I'm so excited to be able to share my passion and creativity with others, and hope that you, too, can find a piece that inspires you. </p>
