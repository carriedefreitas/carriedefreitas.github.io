   		<h3>About Me</h3>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Carrie de Freitas, and welcome to Carried with You. My love of sewing began over a decade ago, and since then, I've enjoyed creating both original and pattern-inspired pieces for myself, family and friends. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm so excited to be able to share my passion and creativity with others, and hope that you, too, can find a piece that inspires you.</p>
